            <div class="art-description">Drawing inspiration from a captured moment of my own childlike wonder, 
            and its striking resemblance to John Brosio's Two Earthlings painting; I sought to illuminate the 
            interconnectedness of all life that exists and has existed on Earth. I obscured the intricacies of 
            the skeleton and my own reflection in attempts to deconstruct the tendency to think of these creatures 
            as separate from ourselves. We will all leave behind our skeletons.</div>

            one individual">

    <div class="art-description">This painting is based on a picture captured by Instagram user @subwayhands, a 
    photographer that captures photos of hands of commuters on the subway. The yellow light that illuminates the 
    hands draws attention to their shared space, despite their closeness likely being temporary and circumstantial. 
    Togetherness that simultaneously involves separation.</div>

    <div class="art-description">This was my first attempt at a perspective drawing! Complete accuracy is not my strong
         suit, so when the successful completion of this piece involved precise measurement I was quite worried. This 
         was a monumental part of my understanding of perspective, and additionally my first introduction to using 
         charcoal. I was able to capture the texture of the bricks by leaning the paper against some cardboard. Also, 
         this reference photo was taken of my favorite corner in the library I used to work at!</div>

        look like discarded items. The materials are carefully placed, and primarily consist of a beige and pastel pink 
        color scheme. There is a figure outlined with brown lipstick seated on an oversized chair detailed with orange

            <div class="art-description">This is a further exploration of my intrigue with utilizing found materials 
                for collage, which in simple terms is- trash holds so much potential for reinvention. I made this piece 
                to reflect on a period of my life in which I felt disposable in my relationships, and was noticing the 
                ways it impacted initiation of my present relationships.</div>
