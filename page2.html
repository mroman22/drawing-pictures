            while I was taking a nap. I wanted to capture a sense of how peaceful it was for my 
            mother at that moment (especially since this stillness only occurred while I was
             sleeping- I was very hyperactive back then!). I am using my 'sketching style' of 
             delicate strokes and limited contrast to gently portray the intimacy in this moment.</div>

        sketches! Lately, I have been further exploring my love of unfinished drawings by choosing live subjects I 
        know will eventually move. I spend this time filling in as much detail as I can, looking for the most 
        compelling spots and allowing myself to shift if I get bored!</div>

             where I have drawn them and my friends, as these connections are some of my primary sources 
             of inspiration for artmaking. The intimacy of friendship is a concept I am constantly exploring, 
             and forever in awe of. (I love you Natasha!)</div>

            This sketch was created during a 30-minute drawing session from a live figure model. 
            There are some moments I lose myself and become completely absorbed in drawing- and 
            this was one of those special moments. Figure drawing was a challenge for me, as I am 
            detail-oriented and typically work at a slower pace. Additionally, I am quite stubborn 
            about not using too many guidelines while drawing- since I find too much planning disrupts
             the flow of my linework. Maybe it makes it harder to predictably be anatomically correct, 
             but here it all worked out!</div>
