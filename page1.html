<div class="art-description"> This drawing was created over the span of a few months,
the first being the left tree trunk that was created in anticipation of a hike.
The branches followed a few months later, prompted by studies of ecocentrism and
environmental justice. I was drawn to compile discarded pieces of paper- this practice
expanded beyond this project and is now a huge part of my artmaking.</div>

        <img src="images/IMG_1002-2.jpg" alt="A collage of an ink wash tree draping 
        itself across an abstract landscape. There are pencil markings that allude 
        to icicles and lightning in the sky, and ripples on the ground that echo both 
        water and tree rings detailed by white charcoal on black paper. There is a black 
        rectangle viewfinder that draws attention to a point where all of these elements 
        intersect.">

        <div class="art-description">This collage initially began with a repeated
            pattern to visualize icicles, and I began to notice the shape's ability 
            to represent multiple aspects of nature. The icicle shapes were 
            additionally present in lightning, the ripples in water, tree rings, and 
            tree branches. The black square was initially only meant to be a viewfinder
            to zero in on a specific section of the piece, but I ended up enjoying
            its presence alongside everything else.</div>

<div class="art-description">This was the first drawing I used mechanical pencils
(now my favorite material)! I wanted to capture the intricate details of tree bark,
and explore the shapes tree hollows leave behind. I found that getting up close to 
this tree allowed me to capture the tiniest of details, and I simultaneously felt 
grounded with the world around me.</div>

            <div class="art-description">This drawing is in conversation with the last one, to illustrate how trees look 
                on a cellular level. Truthfully, I was fascinated with the fact that under a 
                microscope wood reminded me of the ripped fishnet stockings I used to wear. 
                Ultimately, I find trees to be intensely compelling- and portraying them in various
                forms is an attempt to visualize my fixation.</div>
